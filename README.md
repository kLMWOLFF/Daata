## Description
Da’ata is a VR game where you control gravity, affecting 2 main elements: discs and clouds. By attracting and combining discs, unique landscapes spawn around you. However, by maintaining or relieving gravity for too long, you may destroy your environment. Maintaining balance is essential to build the space around you. Inspired by Kabbalah’s Tree of Life, the game explores world building from nothingness. Da’ata is an experience where your curiosity becomes the catalyst for cyclic growth in a universe of your own making.
